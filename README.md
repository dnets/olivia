# Olivia
## Description

A HTML5 implementation of Shahin Srowar's Olivia design. Original design had no specification for mobile/tablet, so improvised design decisions were made, such as putting contacts in sliders and using alternative slider for screenshots for Bootstrap's xs and sm breakpoints (<991px).
